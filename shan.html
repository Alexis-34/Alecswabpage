          C is a powerful general-purpose programming language developed at AT & T's Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972.It was designed and written by Dennis Ritchie. C become popular because it is reliable, simple, and easy to use.C Programming used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.  
Although numerous computer languages are used for writing computer applications, the computer programming language, C, is the most popular language worldwide. Everything from microcontrollers to operating systems is written in C since it's very flexible and versatile, allowing maximum control with minimal commands. If you are interested in a career in computer programming, it would be wise to start by learning the C programming language.

        Java is the one of the most  
        popular programming language  
        for many years. Java is also known as Object  
        Oriented Programming Language. But we cannot say that Java is not  
        considered as pure object-oriented  
        as it provides support for primitive  
        data types (like int, char, etc) The  
        Java codes are first compiled into byte  
        code (machine-independent code). Then  
        the byte code is run on Java Virtual  
        Machine (JVM), regardless of the  
        underlying architecture.
